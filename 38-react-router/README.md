* Understand how react-router works
* Use `<BrowserRouter></BrowserRouter>` to let react-router control routing
* Use `<Switch>` to change between routes
* Use `<Route>` to render a specific component using the `component` prop
  * Also use the `render` prop to pass custom props
* Use router props that we get from implimenting react-router
* Use `<Link>` to replace `<a>` tags
* *BONUS:* Use `withRouter` HOC to add in router props to any component
